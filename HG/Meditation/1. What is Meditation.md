Meditation originate from 3 words:

1. **Dharana**, a verb means focusing and technique. Meditation action and technique we can do. 
2. **Dhyana**, state of mind. When people do Dharana, and they are lucky, they will enter Dhyana. Dhyana is a state feels incredibly peaceful.
	- Exlpaination: We can go to bed(Dharana), but we can't control ourself to sleep(Dhyana)
	- People who "bad" at meditation, the more your mind wanders, the better you are going to get at meditation. Bring back our focus is like doing a pushup, everything we bring it back, you are strengthening for brain.
	- Benefits of meditation take about 8 weeks to kick in.
		- Dr.K thinks it is because when you enter the state of Dhyana is when your neurons are rewiring.
- **Samedhi**, temporary state of enlightenment. The goal of meditation is to attain "enlightenment" or "Moksha". Samedhi is a substate of Dhyana.
	- Sometimes people meditation for a long period of time become a different people. Dr.K thinks it is come out of the state of Samadhi

There has yet be a single person he have taught in 20 years, once they find the right technique, they still this they are bad at meditation.
