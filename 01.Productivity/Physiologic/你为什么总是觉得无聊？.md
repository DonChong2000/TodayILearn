# Why we feel bored?

John EastWood: “the aversive experience of wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity“

or more specifically:
1. We (a) are not able to successfully engage attention with internal (e.g., thoughts or feelings) or external (e.g., environmental stimuli) information required for participating in satisfying activity
2. We are not able to engage attention and participate in satisfying activity
3. Attribute the cause of our aversive state to the environment

無聊是一種想要做讓人滿足的事情，但又做不了的讓人厭惡的狀態

Random ppl talking:
what they know now is that when you get bored you activate a network in your brain call the default mode. This network ignite your most original thinking. It is where you do your best problem-solving. And you also do something called =="Autobiographical planning"==. You set goals and then you figure out the steps you need to take to reach those goals.
