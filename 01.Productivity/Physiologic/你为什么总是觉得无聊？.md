# Why we feel bored?

John EastWood: “the aversive experience of wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity“

or more specifically:
1. We (a) are not able to successfully engage attention with internal (e.g., thoughts or feelings) or external (e.g., environmental stimuli) information required for participating in satisfying activity
2. We are not able to engage attention and participate in satisfying activity
3. Attribute the cause of our aversive state to the environment

無聊是一種想要做讓人滿足的事情，但又做不了的讓人厭惡的狀態

# Boredom's usage

Random ppl talking:
what they know now is that when you get bored you activate a network in your brain call the default mode. This network ==ignite your most original thinking==. It is where you do your best problem-solving. And you also do something called =="Autobiographical planning"==. You set goals and then you figure out the steps you need to take to reach those goals.

Boredom is not a bad thing. After doing boring things, your creativity increase.

# Why people get bored nowadays, given so many entertainment

Due to Homeostasis(內穩態), whenever dopamine levels rise, the body attempts to restore balance by reducing its release, leading to a drop in dopamine levels.

With the proliferation of entertainment options in modern life, it is easier than ever to trigger dopamine release. Rapid dopamine release will decrease the dopamine's release, and cause a deeper drop. If we keep having so many enterrainment, whatever we do, peak of domaine will never reach the normal level, so we are bored whatever we do.

# How to increase the baseline of dopamine


1. ==Expose in sunlight for 10-30 mins==

My question: what is the difference between the raise of dopamine between scrolling phone and sunlight?

Striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was significantly greater in the subjects with highsunshine exposure than in those with low-sunshine exposure

The retinal circadian clock increases dopamine release in the day
compared to night, activating high-affinity dopamine D4 receptors on cones

Maintained (30 min) bright illumination in the day compared to maintained
darkness releases sufficient dopamine to activate low-affinity dopamine D1 receptors on cone-bipolar cell dendrites.

chatGPT:
Retinal circadian rhythm refers to the daily biological cycle that is controlled by the internal clock of the retina, which is a layer of specialized cells located at the back of the eye. This rhythm is regulated by a group of genes that are responsible for controlling various processes, such as the synthesis and degradation of proteins, in a 24-hour cycle.

NOTE: Sample size is small
Results from the present study suggest that enhancement of ==DA function may be responsible for some of the beneficial effects of light==. In addition, these and findings from relevant studies support the hypothesis that the ==neurobiology of mood and motivational states can be dissociated in humans.==

2. Get good sleep

[Evidence That Sleep Deprivation Downregulates Dopamine](Evidence%20That%20Sleep%20Deprivation%20Downregulates%20Dopamine.pdf)
Dopamine D2 receptors are involved with wakefulness. And these findings are consistent with a downregulation of D2/D3 receptors in ventral striatum with sleep deprivation that may contribute to the associated decreased wakefulness. 

Sleep-deprived mice showed a significant decrease in D1R, no change in D2R, and a significant increase in D3R binding in striatum.

3. Don't take melatona

Dopamine (DA) content of the posterior pituitary was decreased progressively by melatonin administration, with a reduction of greater than 50% after 5 weeks of treatment

4. L-tyrosine intake

- Cheese
- Beef
- Fish
- Nuts

5. Take adequate caffine
