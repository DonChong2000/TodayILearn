Our eye has light detection mechanism, which tells our brain what time of the day it is, and helps regulate our interal clock.
Distrupted circadian rhythms might lead to inscrease of stress hormones, risk of heart disease, rate of illness, and more prone to emotional and congnitive problems.

BUT: everyone's circadian rhythms is different, e.g morning person and night owl, which are called [Chronotype](Keywords/Chronotype.md)
e.g: someone gets up early and find the morning be the most productive is likely a Morning Chronotype.

We can figure out what our chronotype is by [this questionnarie]([AutoMEQ (chronotype-self-test.info)](https://chronotype-self-test.info/index.php?sid=61524&newtest=Y)). We can arrage our activities around to fit our chronotype

Prof: 8 Hours of sleep is average value, not a optimum value! A healthy sleep can range from 6 hours (or a bit less) to 10,11 hours.

These questions help you to know if you have a good sleep: 
- Did you wake up naturally or did you need an alarm?
	- Generally If you wake up naturally, you got a pretty reasonable amount of sleep.
- Did it take you a long to wake up, and did you feel the need for caffeine.
	- If so, you didn't  get enough sleep
- Is your behaviour strange and erratic, like doing stupid things, being mean and unempathetic
	- If so, you did't get engouh sleep

### 3. We should wake up at the same timee everyday

Prof: Wake up at the same time, earrinf at time same time, getting light exposure at time same time,all acts to stabilise Circadian rhythms. But there's gonna be an occasion were we don't, and sleep is dynamic

When we age, we move to a more morning chronotype


### 4. You should aviod blue light before sleep

Prof: Harvard group let people



### 5. Sleep apps help you sleep better
### 6. Melatonin helps us sleep better
### 7. Polyphasic sleep us good for you productivity
