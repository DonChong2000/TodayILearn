# Myths: 

### 1. It doesn't matter when you sleep as long as you sleep enough

tldr: It matter cause circadian rhythms, which is controlled by light.

When we sleep is imoprtnat as is [Circadian rhythms](Keywords/Circadian%20rhythms.md).
Our eye has light detection mechanism, which tells our brain what time of the day it is, and helps regulate our interal clock.
Distrupted circadian rhythms might lead to inscrease of stress hormones, risk of heart disease, rate of illness, and more prone to emotional and congnitive problems. 

Prof: 97% of worker do not adapt to the demands of working at night

BUT: everyone's circadian rhythms is different, e.g morning person and night owl, which are called [Chronotype](Keywords/Chronotype.md)
e.g: someone gets up early and find the morning be the most productive is likely a Morning Chronotype.

We can figure out what our chronotype is by [this questionnarie]([AutoMEQ (chronotype-self-test.info)](https://chronotype-self-test.info/index.php?sid=61524&newtest=Y)). We can arrage our activities around to fit our chronotype

### 2. Everyone needs 8 hours of sleep

tldr: 8 is just average, it depends on people, and their situration. It can be 6 to 11 hr of sleep.

Prof: 8 Hours of sleep is average value, not a optimum value! A healthy sleep can range from 6 hours (or a bit less) to 10,11 hours.

These questions help you to know if you have a good sleep: 
- Did you wake up naturally or did you need an alarm?
	- Generally If you wake up naturally, you got a pretty reasonable amount of sleep.
- Did it take you a long to wake up, and did you feel the need for caffeine.
	- If so, you didn't  get enough sleep
- Is your behaviour strange and erratic, like doing stupid things, being mean and unempathetic
	- If so, you did't get engouh sleep

### 3. We should wake up at the same time everyday

tldr: it would be good, as it stablize circadian rhythm, yet it is not a hard rule to follow, our sleep can adapt to it quickly. And our chronotype differ when we age.

Prof: Wake up at the same time, eatting at time same time, getting light exposure at time same time,all acts to stabilise Circadian rhythms. But there's gonna be an occasion were we don't, and sleep is dynamic

When we age, we move to a more morning chronotype. Teenager tend to have a more evening chronotype


### 4. You should aviod blue light before sleep

Prof: Harvard group let people to look at a kindle on its brightest intensity for four hours just before bedtime on five consecutive nights. And it just statistically delayed sleep onset by 10 mins. it mayt be statistically significant, but it is biologically meaningless.

The paper prof memtion: [Unrestricted evening use of light-emitting tablet computers delays self-selected bedtime and disrupts circadian timing and alertness](Paper/Effects%20of%20Evening%20Tablet%20Use%20on%20Sleep%20and%20Alertness.pdf)

NOTE: Looking to a smartphone is differ from looking to a kindle. More study is needed for using smartphone before bed. #todo 

### 5. Sleep apps help you sleep better

Prof: Currently no sleep app are endorsed by any of the sleep federations or FDA approved.

### 6. [Melatonin](Keywords/Melatonin.md) helps us sleep better

tldr: melatonin does reduct time to fall as sleep, but it is not significant.

Prof: The best study ever undersaken show taking melatonin before bed, reduce the time it take to sleep by 30mins. Many study showed no effect whatsoever.

The research prof mention: [A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of controlled release melatonin treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome and impaired sleep maintenance in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities](Paper/Melatonin%20treatment%20for%20sleep%20disorders%20in%20children%20with%20neurodevelopmental%20disabilities.pdf)

Another study show melatonin reduces your time to fall asleep for 7.06 mins.

### 7. Polyphasic sleep us good for you productivity

What is polyphasic sleep (by ChatGPT)
Polyphasic sleep means taking many short naps throughout the day instead of one long sleep at night.

Prof: all of the data suggest that this is a really bad idea. Work of quality is generally lower as we tend to me more exhausted and therefore less productive and less creative in those hours.

Paper show student who are on a polyphasic sleep: [Irregular Sleep Patterns Linked to Poor Academic Performance and Delayed Circadian Rhythm](Paper/Irregular%20Sleep%20Patterns%20Linked%20to%20Poor%20Academic%20Performance%20and%20Delayed%20Circadian%20Rhythm.pdf).
