1. Medical Evaluation
	1. if there's some kind of pathology going on like if you can correct your thyroid level. Then the problem is solved
2. Isolate sleeping problem
	1. Sleep Diary, find out what is my sleeping problem. Hard to fall asleep? Hard to stay asleep? or Hard to wake up? Or I feel tired during the day. Answer the following question for 1 month
		- What time do you fall asleep?
		- What time do you wake up?
		- how rested are you 1-10?
		- what technology is used before bed?
		- what was your bedtime routine?
		- what is caffeine, alcohol intake on that day?
		- what stress did you have that day?
		- Dreams?
3. Time outdoor
	- Nowadays people have No Horizons, No sunlight, same stimulus all day long
	- ==[Circadian rhythms](Keywords/Circadian%20rhythms.md)==
	- Go outside during the day and at dusk
	- ==gain Vitamin D, will decrease your depression==
4. Structured bed time routine
	- 2 hours before bed, no screen
	- No phone, tablet, laptop in bed
	- ==Screens inhibit melatonin==
	- Reduce dopamine and stimulate levels before bed. (Youtube, TikTok, etc are built to stimulate your dopamine)
	- ###### Instead, you can do:
		- Grocery shopping
		- ==Clean==
			- Reduce stress and anxiety -> easier fall as sleep. 
			- Bonus of clean place
		- Sort Mail
		- Yoga / Exerise / ==Meditation==
		- ==Hot Bath==
			- peripheral vasodilation
			- Alterations in blood vessels
			- These make you sleepy
	- ==Aduio Book / Physical Books==
1. Food
	1. Start ==breakfast with Oatmeal== (High Fiber, High satiety, low calorie), so that you won't have huge lunch. Like 08:00
	2. ==Pre-emphasis lunch==. Eat lunch before you are hungry, like 11:30, not too calorie dense, e.g a sandwich. Calorie deficit breakfast makes you crave unhealthy food.
	3. 6-7pm, ==Eat whatever you want for dinner==. You gonna be famished because of the calorie deficit. High GI will make you pass the fuck out.
