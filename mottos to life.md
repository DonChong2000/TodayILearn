## What is Warren Buffett’s 5/25 Rule?

Warren Buffet’s 5/25 rule is a productivity strategy based on three simple steps:

-   Write down a list of your top 25 career goals.
-   Circle the 5 most important goals that truly speak to you. These are your most urgent goals and the highest priorities to focus on.
-   Cross off the other 20 goals you have listed that hold less importance.
