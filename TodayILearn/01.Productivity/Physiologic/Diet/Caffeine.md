Caffeine is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system. It works by blocking the action of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that helps you sleep. [When caffeine blocks adenosine, it causes neurons in your brain to fire, which leads to increased brain activity and alertness](https://science.howstuffworks.com/caffeine.htm)[1](https://science.howstuffworks.com/caffeine.htm). [Caffeine also increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which can improve mood, reaction time, and cognitive function](https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html)[2](https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html).
