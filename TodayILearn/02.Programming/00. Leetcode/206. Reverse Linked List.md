Recursive approach
1. Save head.next to temp, remove head.next 
2. reverse temp
3. append head to tail of temp
4. return the temp's head
# My solution without any input

### Recursive Approach V1:
Code:
```js
var reverseList = function(head) {
    // Recursive approach
    // 1. Save head.next to temp, remove head.next 
    // 2. reverse temp
    // 3. append head to tail of temp
    // 4. return the temp's head
    if(!head){return head;}
    if(!head.next){return head;}
    let temp = head.next;
    head.next = null;
    temp = reverseList(temp);
    let newHead = temp;
    while(temp.next){
        temp = temp.next;
    }
    temp.next = head;
    return newHead;

};
```
Explanation:
It works, yet poor performance.
The while next part cost a lot.

# Recursive Approach V2:
```js
var reverseList = function(head) {
    if(!head || !head.next){return head;}
    // 1. reverse the rest list
    // 2. join head to tail, where head's next will be the "tail"
    // 3. remove head's next

    let revList = reverseList(head.next)
    head.next.next = head; //Point head's next's next to itself
    head.next = null;// cleanse next
    return revList;
};
```

### Iterative Approach V1:

```js
var reverseList = function(head) {
    // Iterative appraoch
    if(!head || !head.next){return head;}

    let current = head;
    let prev = null;
    while(current){
        let next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    return prev;
};
```
Solution in programming 101, just manipulating pointer backward.

# My solution After studying others answer

### Recursive Approach: 
```js
var reverseList = function(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) return head;
    const reversedList = reverseList(head.next);
    head.next.next = head;
    head.next = null;
    return reversedList;
};
```

### Iterative approach: 
Input: 28ms sample
```js
var reverseList = function(head) {
let prev=null;
let curr=head;
while(curr !== null){
    const nextNode = curr.next;
    curr.next=prev;
    prev= curr;
    curr=nextNode;
}
return prev;
};
```

1. His code is nearly identical to mine, by running his code, the performance varies and doesn't met 28ms.
2. Note that the checking head part is unnecessary, because if 
	1. head is null, it will skip the while part, and return prev, which is null
	2. head.next is empty, prev will the the head, and therefore return head.
```js
var reverseList = function(head) {
    // Iterative appraoch
    let current = head;
    let prev = null;
    while(current){
        let next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    return prev;
};
```
