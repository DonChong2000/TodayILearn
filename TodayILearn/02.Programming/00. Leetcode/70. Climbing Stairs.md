# My solution without any input

### V1:
Code:
```js
var climbStairs = function(n) {
    // From n, do recursive, -1 and -2, is end with 0, count++
    if(n == 0){return 1;}
    if(n < 0){return 0;}
    return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
};
```
Explanation:

# My solution with conceptual Input


Prompt: What is dynamic programming
Here is what ChatGPT saids:
It is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem **only once**, storing the results of each subproblem and reusing them as needed. 

### V1: 
Input:
Code:
```js
   let stepsOfN = [1,2];
   
   var climbStairs = function(n) {
       // From n, do recursive, -1 and -2, is end with 0, count++
       if(stepsOfN.length >= n){return stepsOfN[n-1]}
       if(n < 0){return 0;}
       if(stepsOfN.length == n-1){
           stepsOfN[n-1] = climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
           return stepsOfN[n-1];
       }
   
       return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
   };  
```

# My solution After studying others answer

### V1: 
Input:
```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var climbStairs = function(n) {
    
    if (n < 2) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    let firstStep = 1;
    
    let secondStep = 1;
    
    let thirdStep = 0;
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        
        thirdStep = firstStep + secondStep;
        
        firstStep = secondStep;
        
        secondStep = thirdStep;
    }
    return thirdStep;
};
```
Explanation:

The problem itself is Fibonacci Sequence.
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 5
5: 8
6: 13

You can observe this fact from the return statement `return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2)`
