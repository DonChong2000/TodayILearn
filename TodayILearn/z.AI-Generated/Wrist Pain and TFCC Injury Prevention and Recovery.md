# Introduction
This video discusses wrist pain and the prevention and recovery of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) injuries. It provides insight into the causes of wrist pain, with a focus on TFCC injuries, and emphasizes the importance of early prevention for healthy wrists.

# Main Content
- TFCC injuries are due to an injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex inside the wrist, leading to stiffness and immobility in the wrist.
- TFCC is a resilient type of cartilage in the wrist, akin to the intervertebral disc of the wrist, and is essential for wrist protection.
- Various movements, such as lifting, grasping, and activities involving incorrect wrist angles, can trigger TFCC injuries.
- Simple tests are provided to ascertain if one has a TFCC injury, highlighting the need for a prompt visit to a rehabilitation department or orthopedic clinic for thorough examination.
- Exercises to enhance wrist mobility, stability, and strength, with a focus on resistance training for wrist extensor and flexor muscles, and rotational and radial/ulnar deviation training, are detailed.

# Conclusion
- Regular wrist exercises not only enhance stability but also increase muscle elasticity, improving wrist mobility and strength, crucial for preventing TFCC injuries and promoting recovery.
- Strengthening the wrist muscles is key to protecting the TFCC and reducing the risk of sports injuries and overuse.

# Additional Notes
- It is essential to consult a doctor for confirmed TFCC injuries and perform exercises within a pain-free range.
- Relaxation exercises prior to training can help reduce compensation during training, thereby lowering the risk of injury.
