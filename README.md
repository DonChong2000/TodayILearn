# TodayILearn
Welcome to TodayILearn, a repository where I document what I learn every day with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Here, you'll find a collection of short posts about various topics, ranging from programming to personal development.

# Motivation
I was inspired by one of my colleagues who would always exclaim, "Today I learn!" whenever he acquired new knowledge. Despite being an older man who had made a career change a few years prior, he emphasized the importance of lifelong learning. Motivated by his example, I created this repository to keep myself accountable and dedicated to continuous learning. By publicly sharing what I learn every day, my hope is to inspire others to do the same and provide assistance to those who are interested in learning the same topics.

# Topics
The topics covered in this repository are diverse and varied. Some of the topics include:

- Productivity

	This category aims to increase the rate of learning and doing stuff by methodology and physiology. Productivity is the foundation of effective learning, therefore it is the first category of TodayILearn. 

- Programming

	Currently, my focus is on learning LeetCode and programming methodology, which includes various other programming concepts that I come across.

 - Career
 
	This topic studies what skills my career needs.

- Generic skills

	Some skills are applicable to many places, which is valuable as they are versatile and can improve every aspect of our life.

- HG-Meditation

	I am currently learning how to meditate through the tutorial provided by HealthyGamerGG, who is a psychiatrist of Indian descent. His approach to meditation is both scientific and traditional, providing a comprehensive understanding of this practice.
