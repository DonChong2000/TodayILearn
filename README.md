# TodayILearn
Welcome to TodayILearn, a repository where I document what I learn every day with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Here, you'll find a collection of short posts about various topics, ranging from programming to personal development.

# Motivation
I was inspired by one of my colleagues who would always exclaim, "Today I learn!" whenever he acquired new knowledge. Despite being an older man who had made a career change a few years prior, he emphasized the importance of lifelong learning. Motivated by his example, I created this repository to keep myself accountable and dedicated to continuous learning. By publicly sharing what I learn every day, my hope is to inspire others to do the same and provide assistance to those who are interested in learning the same topics.
