These are the guidelines released by Instagram for uploading photos:

-   Use the most recent version of the Instagram app.
-   Upload a photo with an aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5.
-   Upload a photo with a maximum width of 1080 pixels and a minimum width of 320 pixels.

Any photo wider than 1080 pixels will be compressed, and you will lose detail. Photos smaller than 320 pixels wide will be enlarged, which will also produce blurriness.

Any photo that doesnâ€™t meet the aspect ratio requirements will be cropped to acceptable dimensions.
