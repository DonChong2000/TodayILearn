Ask chatGPT to summerize: [乳化作用 | 科學Online (ntu.edu.tw)](https://highscope.ch.ntu.edu.tw/wordpress/?p=4730)
Here is what ChatGPT saids:
Title: Emulsification

- Emulsification refers to the process where **two originally immiscible liquids** (e.g. oil and water) are **dispersed in each other to form a homogeneous mixture** by vigorous shaking or adding surfactants.
- The resulting liquid is called an emulsion, which consists of a continuous phase (usually water) and a dispersed phase (usually oil).
- Emulsification works by **reducing the interfacial tension** between the two liquids, allowing them to mix together with the help of surfactants, which have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties.
- Emulsification has biological examples, such as in the small intestine where fats are emulsified by bile to increase their surface area and improve absorption.
- Surfactants that can lower interfacial tension and cause emulsification are called **emulsifiers, which consist of both polar and nonpolar groups that can dissolve in both water and oil.**

Title: 乳化作用

- 乳化作用指的是**兩種原本互不相溶的液體**（例如：油和水）經過強烈攪拌或加入表面活性劑後分散在彼此之中，**形成均勻的混合物的過程**。
- 所形成的液體稱為乳化液，其由流動相（通常為水）和固定相（通常為油）組成。
- 乳化作用是**通過表面活性劑降低兩種液體之間的介面張力來實現的**，使其混合在一起。
- 乳化作用在生物學中也有例子，例如在小腸中，脂肪能被膽汁乳化成小顆粒以提高其吸收效率。
- 可以降低界面張力並引起乳化作用的表面活性劑稱為**乳化劑，其由親水基和親油基組成**。
