- Sodium Citrate plays a pivotal role as a food additive, especially in processed cheese like American Cheese.
- **It helps cheese melt into water or other fluid**
# Homemade Preparation

- Create a homemade version by combining lemon or lime juice with baking soda (citric acid and sodium bicarbonate).
- Blend the two until no bubbles remain, resulting in a mixture with a less pronounced sour taste.

# Application
