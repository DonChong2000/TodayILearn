## Steps: 

## 1. Prepare rice, sausage
1. Wash **rice** 3 times
2. Soak the **Chinese sausage** (2 links) in boiling water.
3. Rehydrate **shiitake mushrooms** by soaking in boiling water for approximately 10 minutes. 
   
   ## 2. Cut and wash chicken
   1. Cut the **chicken thigh** (1 piece) into small pieces.
   3. Cut the **chicken breast** (1 piece) in half and then into thick slices. (optional)
   5. Rinse the thigh pieces to remove potential bone shards by swirling them in water. The bone shards will sink to the bottom of the water as you pull the chicken pieces out.
   
## 3. Prep  mushrooms, shallot, ginger,scallions

**Shiltake mushroom**
- Cut 1 into third, discarding stems
- Squeeze excess water for better flavor absorption.

**Shallot and ginger (1 tbsp each)**
Finely mince into small pieces.

**Scallions (2 stalks)** 
Dice for garnish, keeping separate from shallot and ginger.
- Use separate tools for vegetables to prevent contamination from raw chicken.
