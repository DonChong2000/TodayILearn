   ## 2. Prep rice and sauages
   1. Cut the **chicken thigh** (1 piece) into small pieces.
   3. Cut the **chicken breast** (1 piece) in half and then into thick slices. (optional)
   5. Rinse the cut bone-in chicken thigh pieces to remove potential bone shards by swirling them in water.
   6. Inspect each piece for floating bone shards, and place the rinsed, debris-free pieces into a colander.
   7. The bone shards will sink to the bottom of the water as you pull the chicken pieces out.
