### Evidence:
- Both US and Japan market at all time high
- US: Has risk of recession, yield curve inversion, Too high shiller PE, leading to negative expected return [[Is the Market overvalued?]]. 
- Japan:
	- CPI 3.2%, first time positive
	- under valued as
		- cross holding
		- no bull for a long time
	- Potential
		- Japanese are not in to investing as the lost 30 years, most ppl hold cash on hand due to long time deflaction
	- It is at all time high in 30yrs, which is generally bad, but that also means it is up trending and have a break through
	- PE and shiller PE is at 16.4 and 25 , undervalued. Not sure if it is applicable as the reference is US market.  [[Is the Market overvalued?]]

- Buy FLJP as:
	- low expense ratio
	- exposures to diversity risk
	- able to buy small amount as Japan stocks is 100 minimal
- Hold [[05. Finance/Investment/Decision Log/SDOW|SDOW]] to offset risk of global market drop.
