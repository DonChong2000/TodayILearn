While the two ETFs follow the same strategy, they earn different ratings.

VOO earns a top rating of Gold, while SPY earns the next best rating of Silver. 
Almahasneh says the reason is fees.

**==VOO charges 0.03%, while SPY charges 0.09%.==** 

With all else equal, the fund with the lower fee is more aligned with investorsâ€™ best interests.
