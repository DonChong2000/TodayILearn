# Introduction

We know what we should do, and sometime we do. Yet despite the positve reinforcement we dont implement changes in our life. We are unable to Learn. To explain this we need to look into neurogenesis.

# Neurogenesis
**Hippocampus**: Governs learning and memory.

What inhibits neurogensis in hippocampus?
Mice Expericnce:
> The experiment with rats in a pool of shallow water showed that ==some rats were able to learn from their mistakes and find a new location== of a platform when it was moved, while ==others kept making the same mistake of looking for the platform in the old location==.

Difference of the mice:
- Some mice code a particular behavior, unable to ==re-encode== a new form of behavior.
- Some are able to wipe old behavior and replace it with more optimal behavior.

What introduce this different?
### Fasting

**The most powerful singal to rewire your brain is starvation**. Our brain know we screw up when we can't find food anymore, as our brain evolved for survival. 

Today's society we are inhibiting neurogenesis in teh hippocampus as no matter how many mistake we make, we are still getting high calorically dense food.

# How do you fast?
- Low carbohydrate intake, will help induce neurogenesis.
- 1800 Calories a day will probably start to induce these neurogensis signals
- Intermittent fasting
- Excercise

Cognitive flexibility which is correlated with neurogenesis.
Gamers who have higher cognitive flexibility are higher in rank.
In face the only one cognitive variable correlateds with rank in league of legends, that is your cognitive flexibility.
