# Introduction

We know what we should do, and sometime we do. Yet despite the positve reinforcement we dont implement changes in our life. We are unable to Learn. To explain this we need to look into neurogenesis.

# Neurogenesis
**Hippocampus**: Governs learning and memory.

What inhibits neurogensis in hippocampus?
Mice Expericnce:
> The experiment with rats in a pool of shallow water showed that ==some rats were able to learn from their mistakes and find a new location== of a platform when it was moved, while ==others kept making the same mistake of looking for the platform in the old location==.

Difference of the mice:
- Some mice code a particular behavior, unable to ==re-encode== a new form of behavior.
- Some are able to wipe old behavior and replace it with more optimal behavior.

What introduce this different?
### Fasting

**The most powerful singal to rewire your brain is starvation**. Our brain know we screw up when we can't find food anymore, as our brain evolved for survival. 

Today's society we are inhibiting the starvation and fastnig signal that induce neurogenesis.

> Summary:
> 
> -   Learning from our mistakes is difficult, as we often continue to do things we know are wrong, despite the negative outcomes.
> -   Our brains have limited neurogenesis (development of brain cells), with the hippocampus being the only region where neurogenesis occurs.
> -   The hippocampus governs learning and memory, so inhibiting neurogenesis in this region can prevent us from learning from our mistakes.
> -   An experiment with rats showed that some were able to learn from their mistakes and adapt their behavior, while others could not.
> -   The ability to replace old behaviors with more optimal ones is crucial in overcoming the subconscious blocks that prevent us from learning from our mistakes.

> -   從錯誤中學習往往很困難，因為我們經常繼續做我們知道是錯誤的事情，儘管結果是負面的。
> -   我們的大腦的神經發生有限，海馬迴是唯一有神經發生的區域。
> -   海馬迴統治學習和記憶，因此抑制海馬迴的神經發生可能會阻止我們從錯誤中學習。
> -   一個對老鼠的實驗表明，有些老鼠能夠從錯誤中學習並適應自己的行為，而另一些老鼠則無法。
> -   能夠用更優化的行為替換舊行為對於克服阻止我們從錯誤中學習的潛意識障礙至關重要。
