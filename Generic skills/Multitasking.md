**Def:**
it is not about coding two project with your left hand and right hands.  
  
It is working two or more project at a same period of time. It require you not to mess up and miss details of all taskes. And able to swap between the context quickly. And abilityt


**My thoughts:**


I was inspire by the work experience when I work as chef.
It is like schedule algorithm  for single core cpu.
As science shows human brain can only work on one task, but by scheduling task that can run on background, like fetching data from hard disk then we can free ourselves to do other taskes, and resume when it is ready.

So in real context, I can apply my hair conditioner, and while waiting, I can wash my cloths, and thinking the answer of "what is multitasking".

In work context, we can prioritize dependent tasks, like writing email for enquires, compiling program, moving data etc, outsourcing task to colleagueÂ , etc.

The essence is to run tasks that doest require or require minimal attention, for example, when I working in Canada, I choose to run back home, I am commuting back home, excerising, and learning english all in 40 mins.

But sometimes we should leave our head some space, it is like rebooting our computer, which help us to escape from tunnel vision
