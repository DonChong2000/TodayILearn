I have first-hand experience of this. While I was living in Canada, my bike broke down, and I had to pay my rent. A lot of bad things were happening in that week, and my personal savings were depleted. It was then that I realized the money from my mother was crucial in supporting me and providing a sense of security. I bought a new bike, and I got my salary, and working toward non-neg balace with a happier mindset

Do monks have security? They don't have to worry about living, food, or promotion. They are very secure in terms of material.

# Learn how to savor

**Savoring is the ability to enhance or extend a positive emotional experience**

The more you are able to savor things the more happy you are.

**Money can negatively impact savoring.**
- If I give someone to eat a chocolate, it bring you a lot of happiness.
- If you tell people how much it cost, especially people have to pay for it, it reduces the happiness.

**==The more you think about money, the less you are able to savor things==**


# Prioritize experience over possessions

Doing stuff with money, is happier than getting stuff with money.
E.g: Trip, rafting, museum.

**==savoring experiences that are ordinary or extraordinary leads to about the same amount of Happiness==**
