Thank you for providing me with your study goals. Here’s a study roadmap that I recommend for you to learn AWS:

1.  Start with AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification as it provides a broad overview of AWS services and concepts. [You can use this guide to learn more about AWS concepts, services, security, architecture, and pricing](https://www.w3schools.com/aws/index.php) [1](https://www.w3schools.com/aws/index.php).
2.  [Once you have completed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, you can move on to AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate certification](https://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-study-guide/) [2](https://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-study-guide/). [This certification will help you learn how to design and deploy scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant systems on AWS](https://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-study-guide/) [2](https://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-study-guide/).
3.  [You can also use this guide to learn more about architecting on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/architect/) [3](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/architect/).
4.  [For hands-on experience with AWS services, you can use AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/) [4](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/). [It provides free access to many AWS services for 12 months](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/) [4](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/).
5.  [You can also use AWS Training and Certification resources to learn more about AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/architect/) [3](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/architect/).
