A **height-balanced binary tree** is defined as a binary tree in which the [**height**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-calculate-height-and-depth-of-a-node-in-a-binary-tree/) of the left and the right subtree of any node differ by not more than 1.

For each node, check difference of numbet of child, if it is larger than one, it is unbalanced



~~~js

var isBalanced(root){
    if(（left==null&&right==null） ||root==null){
        return true;
    } 

    let  = isBalanced(left) && isBalanced(right);
    
}




var childOf(root){
  if(root==null){return 0}    
    return childOf(left)+childOf(right)+1;
}
