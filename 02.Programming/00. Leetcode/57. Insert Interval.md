```
**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
**Output:** [[1,5],[6,9]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
**Output:** [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
**Explanation:** Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

# Think

Cases:
1. No overlap, direct insert
2. Head overlap, exist [1,3], new [2,4], merge as [1,4]
3. Tail overlap, exist [2,4], new [1,3], merge as [1,4]
4. Both overlap, exist [1,2], [4,5], new [2,4]

It is a union of 3 intervals

Solution 1:
1. Compare intervals starts,
