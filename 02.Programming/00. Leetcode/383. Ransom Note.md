# Thinking
Same as [242. Valid Anagram](242.%20Valid%20Anagram.md)
But Check every < 0

~~~js

let freq = new Array(26).fill(0);
if (ransom.length<magazine.length)
for (let i=0;i<megazine.length;i++){
    freq[magazine.charCodeAt(i)]++;
    freq[ransom.chatCodeAt(i)--];
}

return freq.every(e=>e<=0);

# My solution without any input

### V1:
Code:
```js
var canConstruct = function(ransomNote, magazine) {
    if (ransomNote.length>magazine.length) return false;
    let freq = new Array(26).fill(0);
    for (let i=0;i<magazine.length;i++){
        freq[ransomNote.charCodeAt(i)-97]--;
        freq[magazine.charCodeAt(i)-97]++;
    }
    return freq.every(e=>e>=0);  

};
```

- count every letter we have in a string, + for megazinem means a char we can use, - for ransom note means we used a character. If we have negative element at the end means we have char missing
