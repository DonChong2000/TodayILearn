# Thinking

Just a simple binary search lol

# My solution without any input


### V1:
Code:
```js
   var search = function(nums, target) {
       return nums.findIndex((x)=>x == target)
   };
```
Explaination:
I know my code shit, but im too tired to think today.

### V1:
Code:
```js
var search = function(nums, target, start=null, end=null) {
    
    if(start == null){start = 0; end=nums.length-1;}

    let mid = start+Math.floor((end-start)/2);

    if(nums[mid] == target){return mid;}
    if(nums[mid+1] == target){return mid+1}

    if(end-start <= 1){return -1;}

    if (nums[mid] > target){
        return search(nums, target, start, mid);
    }

    if (nums[mid] < target){
        return search(nums, target, mid, end);
    }


};
