**Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm**, A linear major vote algo

Prompt: Explain Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm without code
###### Here is what ChatGPT saids:
The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding the majority element in a sequence of elements, ==provided that the majority element (appearing more than n/2 times==, where n is the length of the sequence) exists. The algorithm was proposed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1981.

The key idea behind the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm is to cancel out pairs of different elements. The algorithm maintains two variables: a candidate and a counter. It iterates through the elements in the sequence, updating the candidate and counter based on the current element.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set the candidate to an arbitrary element.
   - Set the counter to 1.

2. **Iterating through the sequence:**
   - For each element in the sequence:
     - If the counter is 0, set the candidate to the current element and reset the counter to 1.
     - If the current element is equal to the candidate, increment the counter.
     - If the current element is different from the candidate, decrement the counter.

3. **Verification:**
   - After iterating through the entire sequence, the candidate variable holds a potential majority element.
   - Run a second pass through the sequence to count the occurrences of the candidate.
   - ==If the count of the candidate is greater than n/2==, where n is the length of the sequence, then the candidate is the majority element.

The reason this algorithm works is based on the fact that if there is a majority element, ==it will survive the cancellation process== and be left as the final candidate. The algorithm cancels out non-majority elements in a way that ensures the majority element will still be present in the end.

The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm has a ==time complexity of O(n)== and a space complexity of O(1), making it a very efficient solution for finding the majority element in a sequence.


Code:
```js
var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    // Init
    let candidate = nums[0];
    let counter = 1;
    // Iterating
    for(let i = 0;i<nums.length;i++){
        if(counter == 0){
            candidate = nums[i];
            counter = 1;
        }
        if(candidate == nums[i]){
            counter++;
        }else{
            counter--;
        }
    }
    // Verification
    // For test case [6,5,5]
    counter = 0;
    for(let i = 0;i<nums.length;i++){
        if(nums[i] == candidate){counter++};
    }
    if(counter > nums.length/2){
        return candidate
    }else{
        return nums[nums.length-1]
        // I am not sure if this works.
        // But my guess is the problem will only occure when n <= 3.
        // More understanding required
    }

```js
function majorityElement(nums) {
    // Step 1: Initialization
    let candidate = nums[0];
    let count = 1;

    // Step 2: Iterating through the sequence
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (count === 0) {
            // If counter is 0, set the current element as the candidate and reset counter
            candidate = nums[i];
            count = 1;
        } else if (nums[i] === candidate) {
            // If current element is the same as the candidate, increment counter
            count++;
        } else {
            // If current element is different, decrement counter
            count--;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Verification
    // Count occurrences of the candidate
    let candidateCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === candidate) {
            candidateCount++;
        }
    }

    // Check if the candidate is a majority element
    if (candidateCount > nums.length / 2) {
        return candidate;
    } else {
        return null; // No majority element
    }
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2];
const result = majorityElement(nums);
console.log(result); // Output: 2
