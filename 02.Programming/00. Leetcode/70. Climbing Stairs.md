# My solution without any input

### V1:
Code:
```js
var climbStairs = function(n) {
    // From n, do recursive, -1 and -2, is end with 0, count++
    if(n == 0){return 1;}
    if(n < 0){return 0;}
    return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
};
```
Explanation:
A recursive function, treverse all possible steps.
Time Limit Exceeded in test case 21

# My solution with conceptual Input


Prompt: What is dynamic programming
Here is what ChatGPT saids:
It is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem **only once**, storing the results of each subproblem and reusing them as needed. 

### V1: 
Input:
Code:
```js
let stepsOfN = [1,2];

var climbStairs = function(n) {
    // From n, do recursive, -1 and -2, is end with 0, count++
    if(stepsOfN.length >= n){return stepsOfN[n-1]}
    if(n < 0){return 0;}
    if(stepsOfN.length == n){
        stepsOfN[n] = climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
    }
    return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
};  
```
Explanation::
Adding an array to store outputs, passed test case 21, yet Time Limit Exceeded in testcase 31. Likely becase the program did not reuse result well enough
