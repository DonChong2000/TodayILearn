# My solution without any input

### V1:
Code:
```js
var climbStairs = function(n) {
    // From n, do recursive, -1 and -2, is end with 0, count++
    if(n == 0){return 1;}
    if(n < 0){return 0;}
    return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
};
```
Explanation:
A recursive function, treverse all possible steps.
