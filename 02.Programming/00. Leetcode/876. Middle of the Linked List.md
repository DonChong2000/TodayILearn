### V1:
Code:
```js
var middleNode = function(head) {
    // Idea 1:
    // Travese 1.5 times, the first time count the number of node,
    // the second time get the middle node

    // Idea 2:
    // This must not be that simple,
    // list should be very large that we need something better than O(n).
    // two pointer, 1 go double, one go in half
    // let say the length of list is 5
    // Pointer 1    Pointer 2
    // 1            1
    // 2            4
    // 3            reach end at 5

    let slow = head;
    let slow2 = head;
    let fast = head.next;
    let counter = 1;
    let subCounter;
    if(fast){
        if(!fast.next){
            return fast;
        }
    }
    while(fast){
        counter++;
        subCounter++;
        let isBreakPoint = Number.isInteger(Math.log(counter)/Math.log(2));
        if(isBreakPoint){
            slow2 = slow;
            slow = fast;
            subCounter = 0;
        }
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    for(let i = 0; i<Math.floor(subCounter/2)+1;i++){
        slow2 = slow2.next;
    }
    return slow2;

};
```
Explanation:
It save a check point in every n^2, trying to save some time on the second traverse.
### V2:
Code:
```js
var middleNode = function(head) {
    let ptr = head;
    let counter = 0;
    while(ptr){
        counter++;
        ptr = ptr.next;
    }
    ptr = head;
    for(let i=0; i < Math.floor(counter/2);i++){
        ptr=ptr.next;
    }
    return ptr;
};
```
The simple solution, just traversing 1.5 times. Which has a similar runtime as Idea 2.
# My solution with conceptual Input

### V1: 
Input:

Prompt: Hive me conceptual  hints in solving 876. Middle of the Linked List with good computation speed.
Here is what ChatGPT saids:

Two Pointer Approach:
Initialize two pointers, often referred to as slow and fast pointers.
Move the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time.
When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle.
