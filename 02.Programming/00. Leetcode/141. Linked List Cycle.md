Store traversed node, check repeat.

~~~js
var checkRepeat = function(node){
    let traversed = []
    while(node!=null){
        if(node in traversed){
            return true
        }
            traversed.push(node);
            node = node.next
        ;
        
    }
    return false;
}

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

# My solution without any input

### V1:
Code:
```js
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    let traversed = [];
    while(head!=null){
        if(traversed.filter(e=>e==head).length){
            return true;
        }
        traversed.push(head);
        head = head.next;
        ;
    }
    return false;
};
```

# My solution with conceptual Input

### V1: 
Input:
give me conceptral hint on 141. Linked List Cycle
Prompt: 
Here is what ChatGPT saids:
> The concept of a linked list cycle is closely related to the concept of a cycle in a graph. In a linked list, a cycle occurs when there is a loop in the sequence of nodes, meaning that starting from any node, you can traverse the list and eventually reach a node that you've previously encountered.
> 
> To detect a cycle in a linked list, you can use the "two pointers" approach, also known as the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm. This approach involves using two pointers, one moving slower (tortoise) and the other moving faster (hare), and iterating through the linked list.
> 
> Here's a conceptual hint on how to detect a cycle in a linked list using the two pointers approach:
> 
> 1. Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, pointing to the head of the linked list.
> 2. Move the slow pointer one step at a time, and the fast pointer two steps at a time.
> 3. Check at each step if the fast pointer or the next node of the fast pointer is null. If either is null, it means there is no cycle in the linked list.
> 4. If the slow pointer and the fast pointer meet at any point, it indicates the presence of a cycle.
> 
> To summarize, by moving two pointers at different speeds through the linked list, you can detect a cycle if the faster pointer catches up with the slower pointer. This approach takes advantage of the cycle property to identify whether a cycle exists in the linked list.
> 
> Remember to handle special cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one node, appropriately in your implementation.
Code:
```js
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    let hare = tortoise = head;

    while(hare!=null && tortoise!=null){
        hare = hare.next?.next;
        tortoise = tortoise.next;
        if(hare === tortoise){
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false

};
```
Explaination:
if there is a loop in a linked list, two pointer will overlap at some point, just like a clock.
Hour hand, minutes hand will overlap at some point.
# My solution After studying others answer

### V1: 
Input:
```js
var hasCycle = function (head) {
    let p1 = head;
    let p2 = head;

    while (p2 && p2.next && p2.next.next) {
        p1 = p1.next;
        p2 = p2.next.next;

        if (p1 == p2) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};
```
Code:
```js
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    let hare = tortoise = head;
    while(hare && tortoise){
        hare = hare.next?.next;
        tortoise = tortoise.next;
        if(hare === tortoise){
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false
