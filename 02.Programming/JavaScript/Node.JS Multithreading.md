Ask chatGPT to summerize: 

Here is what ChatGPT saids:
- In the context of Node.js, multi-threading can be achieved using **worker threads**.
- Worker threads allow concurrent execution of tasks and utilize separate threads, improving performance.
- By using worker threads, CPU-intensive calculations can be performed without blocking the entire event loop and the application.
- Worker threads can communicate with the main thread through **message passing**, enabling data sharing and synchronization.
