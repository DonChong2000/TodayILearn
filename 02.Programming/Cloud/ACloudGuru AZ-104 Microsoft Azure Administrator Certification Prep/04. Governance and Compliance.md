# Managing Subscriptions

Subscriptions
	- is the billing unit that aggregate all cost of underlying resources
	- Contain resources group and their resources
	- Can use for scoping level for governance and security
	- Can only associate with one AD tenant (one organization) at a time


# Management Groups
- It can contain subscription and management groups
- At most 6 level of hierarchy
- Root management group is not given by default
	- Root management group **cannot be moved or deleted**
	- RBAC (role base access control) is supported for management groups
	- If you are Global Administrators, you can elevate yourself to user Access Administrator of root management group.

# Azure Policy
- It is a set of rules (to deny creation of resources, or audit existing resources)
1. Policy Definition: Criteria for compliance (applicable)
2. Policy assignment: Scope of policy (Subscription and management groups)
3. **Initiative Definition**: A collection of polices to achieve a single high level goal. (As we dont want write a policy for one usecase)

# Tagging Resources

Tags:
- It is Name : Value pair.
- Name is Unique and case-insensitive
- Tages are not inherited
- A resources can have 50 tags

Usage: we can manage resources via tags. e.g. shutdown all VMs with a specific tags

# Locking and moving Resources

Locks:
- It allow you to override permission to resources
- It apply to all user and roles
- You can lock resources groups or resources

Types of Locks:
1. Read Only, no update nor delete. e.g. can't start or stop a vm
2. CanNotDelete, can read and modify, but no delete
3. Inherited Locks, inherited from the parent scopes 

Moving resources;
- If we have Read only lock, we cant move resources
- If we have CanNotDelete lock, we can move resources between resources group
- We can move resources between resources group, subscription and region (moving cross subscription need write permission of other subscription, which will take about later )
- Note: some resources cannot be moved, and require redeployment

# Managing Azure Costs

**What impacts Cost?**
1. Subscription Types: Free, Pay as you go, Enterprise...
2. Resources Type: VM, storage...
3. Usage Meters: CPU time, I/O network traffic, disk size...
4. Resource Usage: Cost of using a resource
5. Region: cost is different in different region

**Best Practices**
1. Choose the right resource, e.g. Azure SQL vs SQL running in a VM
2. Choose the right resource size
3. Deallocate resources when not needed
4. Use cloud capabilities where possible (e.g. use cloud's scalability elasticity to size our infra according to demand)
5. Plan cost before purchase

**Tools**
1. Pricing Calculator
2. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), this can calculate the cost if you do it yourself
3. MS Cost Management
