> Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a brave knight named Sir Cedric. Sir Cedric was known throughout the land for his bravery, his skill with a sword, and his unwavering loyalty to the king.
> 
> One day, while on a routine patrol of the kingdom's borders, Sir Cedric came across a band of fierce bandits who were terrorizing a nearby village. Without hesitation, Sir Cedric drew his sword and charged into battle.
> 
> The bandits fought hard, but Sir Cedric was too skilled for them. He dispatched them one by one until only their leader remained. The leader was a tall, imposing man with a scar across his face.
