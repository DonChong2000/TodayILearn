# How to Secure Root Account
1. Enable MFA (Multi-factor authentication)
2. Create admin group for administrators and assign appropriate permissions
3. Create user account for administrators
4. Add users to the admin group


# How to manage permission

- We define permission by **Policy Document**
- We can assign attach policy document to Groups, Users and Roles.
E.g.: Administrator Access Policy Document:
```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

# Permanent IAM Credentials

Building Block of IAM:
- User: A physical person
- Group: Job Functions, e.g Admin, Developers, and it contain users
- Roles: Internal usage within AWS, e.g EC2 VM access to S3


**Principle:**
- 1 people, 1 user, no sharing
- Least Privilege, only assign a user with minimum amount they need

**Key points:**
- IAM is universal: has nothing to do with region
- Root Account: 
	- Created when you setup your AWS account
	- Complete admin access
	- Secure it asap
	- Do not use it for day to day
- Default User has no any privilege
- Access key ID and secret access keys in not Username and Password
	- Access Key ID and secret access is for programmatic access
- You can only see these secret once, if you lose them you have to regenerate them
- You can create and customize password policy, and always set up password rotations
- IAM Federation: function to combine existing user account with AWS, e.g the account used for login PC
- Iden
