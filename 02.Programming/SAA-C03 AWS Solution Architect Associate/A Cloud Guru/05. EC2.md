# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- A VM hosted in AWS
- you can use it right now (flexible), 
- Grow and shrink when you need (flexible)

**Plans**
- **On Demond**
	- pay by hour/second, price depending instance type
	- Suitable for short-term project and testnig
- **Reserved**
	- Reserve 1-3 years, up to 72% discount per hour charge by paying upfront
	- You can scheduled reserve instance, for fraction of a day/week/month.
		- e.g. reserve more instance at the morning to meet peak requirement of logging in.
	- They operate at a regional level
- **Spot**
	- Purchase unused capacity up to 90% discount
	- Price fluctuate with demand and supply
	- Suitable for flexible start and end time application, e.g rendering.
- **Dedicated**
	- Physical EC2 server, 
	- Compliance, Regulatory requirements don't allow hardware sharing
	- Licensing that don't allow multi-tenancy
	- ==Think of Dedicated Host, when any question talks about special licensing requirements==
		- For example: Windows Server, MS SQL Server, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server


**How to estimate price?**
Use AWS pricing calculator [AWS 定價計算工具](https://calculator.aws/#/)

# AWS Command Line


# EC2 with Roles
- Roles are preferred from security perspective
- Roles avoid hard-coding credentials, allow access without access keys and secret access keys
- We use policies to control role's permission
- Update will immediate effect after updating policies
- You can attach/detach role without stopping the instances

# Security Group
- Virtual firewall for EC2 instance
- By default everything is blocked, to let everything in: use 0.0.0.0/0
- Common Port: SSH:22, Windows RDP: 3389, HTTP:80, HTTPS(SSL):443
- It take immediately effect
- It is many to many, (any no. of EC2 instance within a group, and multi group for a EC2 instance)'
- By default, All inbound traffic is block, all outbount traffic is allowed

# Bootstrap Script (User Data)
- A script runs when the instance first starts.
- It passes user data to the EC2 instance and can used for install application and update, etc.
- Has root permission

# Meta Data
- Meta Data is the data about EC2 instance

**How to retrieve?**
Run command:
`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4`
- We can run this command with bootstrap, to access metadata


# Networking
- **ENI (Elastic Network Interface)**
	- Cheapest, for day-to-day networking
	- It is a virtual network card, that allow:
		- private IPv4, Public IPv4, Many IPv6 Address, MAC address, 1 or more security group.
	- Common Use case
		- Separate network, e.g. management network and production network.
		- Use network and security appliances in VPC
		- Create dual-homed instance on distinct subnets
		- Low budget, high availability solution
- **EN (Enhanced Networking)**
	- High performance, for 10-100 GBPS
		- Higher bandwidth
		- Higher Packet per second (PPS)
		- lower inter-instance latencies
	- SR-IOV (Single root I/O virtualization)
		- Provide higher I/O and lower CPU utilization
	- 2 type: ==Always choose ENA over VF interface==
		- Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)
			- Up to 100 Gbps
			- Always prefer this one
		- Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) Interface 
			- Up to 10Gbps, for older instances
- **EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)**
	- For High Performance Computing (HPC) and Machine Learning
	- Provide low and consistent latency, High throughput 
		- Better than traditional TCP transport in cloud-based HPC system
	- ==OS-Bypass==: Lot faster and much lower latency
		- Enable HPC and machine learning application to bypass operating system kernel and communicate directly with EFA device. Currently only support Linux.
	- If you see scenario question mention High performance computing or Machine Learning, and ask what network adapter to use, USE EFA, and use OS-Bypass!



# Placement Group
- **Cluster**
	- Placed within a single Availability Zone (AZ)
	- High performance, low network latency, High network throughput
- **Spread**
	- Spread across distinct underlying hardware
	- Can spread span multiple AZ
	- For durability, such as backup, or any small number of critical instance
	- This is for ==individual instances==
- **Partition**
	- Each partition is a server rack with dedicated power, network
	- Can spread span multiple AZ
	- Isolate impact of hardware failure
	- This is for ==multiple instances==, e.g. HDFS, HBase, Cassandra

- Only certain types of instance can be launched in a placement group
	- compute optimized, GPU, memory optimized, storage optimized
- AWS recommend to use same type of instance within cluster placement group
- You can not merge placement group
- You can move an existing instance into a placement group
	- Instance must be in stopped state
	- You can move/remove using AWS CLI or AWS SDK, but not a console



# Spot Instance Detail
It save up to 90% of the cost On-Demand instances

✅**Use it For: **
- Any type of computing don't need a persistent storage
- Stateless, fault-tolerant, big data, CI/CD, ==High-performance computing (often question!)==

❌**Do NOT use it for: **
- Persistent workload
- Critical jobs
- Databases

**When EC2 mark a Spot instances for termination, you have 2-minute warning for you to choose continue or not** 

**Spot Block**
- Stop spot instance from terminating, for a period (1-6 hour), even the price exceed desire prices 

**How to start a Spot instance:**
- We create a spot request, define the following:
	- maximum price
	- launch specification
	- Request type: One time / Persistent(valid from when to when)

**How to terminate a Spot instance: **
 - If your Spot request is persistent, you need to first ==cancel the Spot request==, and then terminate the spot instances (or it will start a new instance after you stop a instance)

**Spot Fleet**
Def: Collection of Spot Instance and (optionally) On-Demand Instance
==It will try and match the target capacity with your price restraints.==
- Spot Fleet Request:
	- It will attempt to launch multiple Spot instance and On-Demand instance to meet the target capacity you define
	- It attempt to maintain target capacity if your Spot instance interrupted (restart instances)
	- The request is fulfilled if:
		- There is still available capacity and max price you specified exceed the current spot price.
		- It will stop launching instance once you reach your price threshold or capacity desire
- Pools
	- you can set up different launch pools, and define EC2 instance type, operating system, AZ, etc
	- You can have multiple pools, and the fleet will choose the best pool by your strategy
- Spot Fleets strategy:
	- capacityOptimized
		- Spot instance will launch from pool with optimal capacity
	- diversified
		- Will launch distributed across all pools
	- lowestPrice
		- Default
		- The pool with the lowest price
	- InstancePoolsToUseCount
		- Will launch across number of pool you specify
		- Only Valid with lowestPrice

# vCenter (VMware on AWS)
==You can deploy vCenter on AWS Cloud using VMware==

**VMware**
- Why VMware?
	- popular already for private cloud deployments
- Use cases
	- Hybrid Cloud: Connect your private cloud to AWS (extending VMware cloud)
	- Cloud Migration: Migrate existing cloud to AWS using VMware build-in tools
	- Disaster Recovery: VMware is famous for disaster recovery
	- Leverage AWS: Use over 200 AWS services

**AWS VMware Cloud**
- Dedicated hardware
	- 2 sockets with 18 core per socket
	- 512GB RAM
	- 15.2 TB SSD
- Can run up to 100+ instance
- Can start with 2 two to 16 host per cluster

# AWS Outpost
It brings the AWS data center directly to you, on-premises (local).

**Benefits**
- Hybrid Cloud, Leverage AWS services inside your data center
- Consistency, all AWS services will be the same, but in your data center 
- AWS can manage the infrastructure for you, so you don't need a dedicated team to look after infrastructures

**Outpos**
