S3(Simple Storage Service)

- S3 is object based storage
- You can upload a single file up to 5TB
- You can not install an operating system or run a DB on it
- The total volume and number of object you can store is unlimited
- Build for 99.95% service availability, and 99.999999999% durability.
- Strong Read-After-Write Consistency, after a successful write, all read will immediately receive the latest version

**A S3 object consist the follow:**
- Key: the name of the object
- Value: the data itself
- Version ID: allows you to store multiple version of same object
- Metadata: data about data, e.g. last-modified

**Files is stored in Buckets, and their URLs are constructed as follow:**
- `https://[bucket-name].s3.Region.amazonaws.com/[key-name]`
- e.g.: `https://asutora.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/YouTuber+Makes+Elon+Musk+CHANGE+Rocket+Design+%23shorts.mp4`


# Securing Buckets
- **Bucket are private by default:** and object within it are private by default. You can allow public access on both bucket and object to make object public
- **Object ACL (Access Control List):** you can control access if individual object using ACLs
- **Bucket policies:** You can make entire bucket public using bucket policies
- **HTTP status code:** If you upload an object to S3 successfully, you will receive HTTP 200 code.


# Static Website Hosting
- Use S3 to host static content
- S3 Scales automatically with demand
- You can make entire bucket public using bucket policies
- The website link is different from the object URL
https://asutora.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
http://asutora.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/

# Versioning
- All version of object are stored if you enable versioning. Even you deleted an object.
- Versioning is great backup tool
- Once enabled versioning, you cannot disabled it, only suspended
- Can be integrated with lifecycle rules
- **Support MFA** (multi-factor authentication), to prevent someone else delete object.

# Storage Tier

- Standard: suitable for most things, frequent access
- One Zone IF: only 1 AZ, 99.5% avaliability
- Intelligent-tiering: for unknow un predictable access
- Glacier: Long Term Storage

# Lifecycle
![](../../../z.Images/Pasted%20image%2020230609134859.png)
- Automatically moving object between storage tier
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- can be applied to both current versions and old versions.

# S3 Object Lock
- S3 Object Lock use Write Once Read Many (WORM) Model
- Object lock can be applied to one object or the whole bucket
- Object lock has 2 modes:
	- Governance Mode: Most user cant overwrite/delete  
	- Compliance Mode:
