S3(Simple Storage Service)

- S3 is object based storage
- You can upload a single file up to 5TB
- You can not install an operating system or run a DB on it
- The total volume and number of object you can store is unlimited
- Build for 99.95% service availability, and 99.999999999% durability.
- Strong Read-After-Write Consistency, after a successful write, all read will immediately receive the latest version

**A S3 object consist the follow:**
- Key: the name of the object
- Value: the data itself
- Version ID: allows you to store multiple version of same object
- Metadata: data about data, e.g. last-modified

**Files is stored in Buckets, and their URLs are constructed as follow:**
- `https://[bucket-name].s3.Region.amazonaws.com/[key-name]`
- e.g.: `https://asutora.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/YouTuber+Makes+Elon+Musk+CHANGE+Rocket+Design+%23shorts.mp4`


# Securing Buckets
- **Bucket are private by default:** and object within it are private by default. You can allow public access on both bucket and object to make object public
- **Object ACL (Access Control List):** you can control access if individual object using ACLs
- **Bucket policies:** You can make entire bucket public using bucket policies
- **HTTP status code:** If you upload an object to S3 successfully, you will receive HTTP 200 code.


# Static Website Hosting
- Use S3 to host static content
- S3 Scales automatically with demand
- You can make entire bucket public using bucket policies
- The website link is different from the object URL
https://asutora.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
http://asutora.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/

# Versioning
- All version of object are stored if you enable versioning. Even you deleted an object.
- Versioning is great backup tool
- Once enabled versioning, you cannot disabled it, only suspended
- Can be integrated with lifecycle rules
- **Support MFA** (multi-factor authentication), to prevent someone else delete object.

# Storage Tier

- Standard: suitable for most things, frequent access
- One Zone IF: only 1 AZ, 99.5% avaliability
- Intelligent-tiering: for unknow un predictable access
- Glacier: Long Term Storage

# Lifecycle
![](../../../z.Images/Pasted%20image%2020230609134859.png)
- Automatically moving object between storage tier
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- can be applied to both current versions and old versions.

# S3 Object Lock
- S3 Object Lock use Write Once Read Many (WORM) Model
- Object lock can be applied to one object or the whole bucket
- Object lock has 2 modes:
	- Governance Mode: Most user cant edit an object, unless they have special permission 
	- Compliance Mode: No user can edit, not even root.
- Retention Periods
	- Object lock protect an object version for a fixed amount of time (Retention Period)
- Legal Holds
	- Object lock is active then a legal hold is placed, and remain in effect until removed.
	- Legal hold can be freely placed and removed by user who has s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission.
- S3 Glacier vault lock: Glacier with object lock
	- You can specify control such as WORM in the vault policy and lock the policy from future edit, once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.

# Encryption

Type of Encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**
	- SSL/TLS
	- HTTPS
- **Encryption at Rest**: Server-Side Encryption
	- SSE-S3: Managed by S3, using AES256
	- SSE-KMS: AWS Key Management Service-managed keys
	- SSE-C: Customer-provided keys
- **Encryption at Rest**: Client-Side Encryption, Encrypt yourself before uploading

**2 Ways to Enforce Server-Side Encryption**
- Console: Checkbox in encryption of S3 bucket
- Bucket Policy: Denies any S3 PUT request does not include `x-amz-server-side-encryption` parameter in header. (the policy wont be tested for solution architect)

# S3 Performance

**Prefix**
- Basically is just folders
e.g. mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/myfile.png
prefix: /folder1/subfolder1

- The more prefix, the more performance
S3 can achieve 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5500 GET/HEAD request per second per prefix
==Therefore spread your read across different prefixes to achieve more request==

**KMS limitation**
When using KMS encryption, uploading will call `GenerateDataKey` in KMS API, downloading will call `Decrypt` in KMS API

- Those call will count toward KMS quota, which currently cannot request increase.
- The quota is region-specific, but it is either 5500/10000/30000 request per second

If you asked to trouble shoot a KMS throughput problem, it might be hitting the KMS limit

**Multipart Upload**
- Recommended for file over 100MB
- ==Required for file Over 5GB==
- it parallelize upload and increase efficiency

**S3 Byte-Range Fetches**
- we can parallelize download by specifying byte ranges
- If there is a failure in download, it is only for that specific byte range.
