# TLDR
**AWS Building Blocks**
Availability Zones: Multiple Data Centers in separate facilityies
Region: a physical location consists of 2 or more availability zones
Edge location: for caching content, e.g CDN, CloudFront

**Shared responsibility Model**
Can you do it in AWS
Yes: your responsibility
No: AWS responsibility
Encryption: shared responsibility

**Key services**
Compute: EC2. Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
Storage: S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway
Databases: RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift
Networking: VPCs. Direct Connect, Route 53, API Gateway, AWS Global Accelerator
