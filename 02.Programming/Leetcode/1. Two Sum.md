# My solution without any input


V1
Code:
```js
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i+1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        const element = nums[j];
        if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target){
            return [i,j]
        }
    }
}
```
Explaination:
In all combination of nums, there is one == target, we need the index of the two number
