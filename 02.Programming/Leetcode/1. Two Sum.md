# My solution without any input


V1
Code:
```js
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i+1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        const element = nums[j];
        if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target){
            return [i,j]
        }
    }
}
```
Explaination:
In all combination of nums, there is one == target, we need the index of the two number

V2 (Fail)
Code:
```js
    let mapping = nums.map((val,key)=>[val,key])
       return mapping.flatMap(
           (v, i) => mapping.slice(i+1).map(w=>{
               return [v[0]+w[0]==target,[v[1],w[1]]];
           }
       )).find(combo => combo[0])[1]
```
Explaination:
In all combination of nums, there is one == target, we need the index of the two number
But this time I do it with vector concept

Fail Reason: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc' what():  std::bad_alloc.

The input array is too large for it to handle.
