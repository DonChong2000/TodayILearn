# My solution without any input

### V1:
Code:
```js
var isValid = function(s) {
    let correspondents = {
        "(":")",
        "{":"}",
        "[":"]",
    }

    let next_closings = [];
    
    for(let i = 0;i<s.length;i++){
        if(s[i] in correspondents){
            // if is open, append to to close
            console.log(s[i]);
            next_closings.push(correspondents[s[i]]);
        }else{
            // check is correct closing
            if(s[i] != next_closings.pop()){
                return false
            }
        }
    }

    if(next_closings.length == 0){
        return true;
    }else{
        return false;
    }
};
```

Explaination:
serialize input into stream,
if incomming is open bracket, append to next_closing
if incomming is close bracket, check with the last next_closing, remove if matched.
After processing all inoput, check is next_closing is 0, to make sure all bracket is closed.
