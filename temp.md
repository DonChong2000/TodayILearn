To accomplish the task of sending an email using the Outlook REST API with Node.js, you'll need to ensure you have a few items set up and ready. You'll need to register your application with Azure to obtain the necessary credentials such as client ID and client secret. You'll also need to ensure you have proper permissions granted for sending mails.

Below is a basic example of how you can utilize the Outlook REST API to send an email using Node.js. This example assumes you've already obtained an OAuth2 token for authenticating with the Outlook REST API.

### Step 1: Setup

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, create a new Node.js project and install the `node-fetch` package to make HTTP requests:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install node-fetch
```

### Step 2: Write the Function

Create a file named `sendMail.js` and add the following code:

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function sendEmail(token, recipient, subject, content) {
  const url = 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/sendMail';
  const message = {
    message: {
      subject: subject,
      body: {
        contentType: "Text",
        content: content
      },
      toRecipients: [
        {
          emailAddress: {
            address: recipient
          }
        }
      ],
    },
    saveToSentItems: "true",
  };

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(message)
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to send email: ${response.statusText}`);
  }

  return 'Email sent successfully!';
}

// Example usage
const accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'; // You must replace this with your actual access token
const recipientEmail = 'recipient@example.com'; // Replace this with the recipient's email address
const subject = 'Hello from Node.js!';
const emailContent = 'This is a test email sent using Outlook REST API and Node.js.';

sendEmail(accessToken, recipientEmail, subject, emailContent)
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

### Step 3: Obtain Access Token

To use this function, you'll need an access token for the Outlook API. Access tokens are typically obtained through OAuth2 authentication flow. The exact steps to obtain an access token can vary based on your application type and the permissions it requires. You'll want to look into the Microsoft identity platform documentation to implement OAuth2 in your application to obtain these tokens.

### Step 4: Run the Script

Once you've obtained an access token and replaced the placeholder values in your script with actual data (e.g., access token, recipient email), you can run the script with Node.js:

```bash
node sendMail.js
```

Remember, this example assumes you have the necessary permissions and a valid OAuth2 access token to use the Outlook REST API. Please refer to the official Outlook REST API and Microsoft identity platform documentation for more in-depth guidance on permissions, authentication, and sending emails.
