Nadi: Channel
Shuddhi: Cleaning

This is a practice designed to clean out your body, energy channels and mind.

Nadi Shuddhi is essentially Alternate-Nostril Breathing.

Method:
1. Block on side of our nostril, breadthe in throught the other nostril.
2. Block the other side, and breath out from the previously blocked nostril
3. After practice, let your hand relax, and notice the slight stillness of your mind
4. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale, open your eyes.

Advantage:
- Nerves from your left nostril innervate parasympathetic nervous system, which design to reset and digest our body.
- Nerves from your right nostril activate your sympathetic nervous system, which prime you for action, prep for fight or flight
