# How long should I meditate?
Science: **20 mins** a day, idealy 5-7 a week, but 20mins every other day is enough.
Less than 20 mins a day, don't seem to have clinically statustucally significant benefit.

Why 20mins? a potential explaination is in stress physiology:

Prompt: what is HPA Axis in stress physiology?
Here is what ChatGPT saids:
> The HPA axis is a complex set of interactions between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands that regulates stress response in the body. When we experience stress, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which signals the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol, which is a stress hormone that helps our body respond to stress.
> HPA軸是下丘腦、垂體和腎上腺之間的一套複雜的相互作用，調節體內的壓力反應。當我們經歷壓力時，下丘腦釋放促腎上腺素釋放激素（CRH），這信號垂體釋放促腎上腺皮質激素（ACTH）。然後ACTH刺激腎上腺釋放皮質醇，這是一種應激激素，幫助我們的身體應對壓力。

**Meditation for about 17 mins is what required to shut off the HPA axis.**

# How cortisol affects the different parts of our body?

Cortisol is a hormones, that effect your entire body, it get your body ready for stressful environment.
- Brain:  Reticular Activating Formation (RAF), govern wakefullnes and alertness. In human evolution, it help us sustain alert after stress period, like predators encounter. 
	- Example:
		- it makes us sleep lighter to prepare for second encounter. 
		- Keep us alert to the surroundings, even you focus in one task. So that we can respond to potential predator
- Immune System: Cortisol send signal to our immune system to be on high alert. (Since we might encounter infection from scratches and cuts, our body will get ready for that). Which end our attacking other parts of our body.

We want to create balance level of streess (==**Eustress**==).
- If stress is too low, we feels boring
- If stress is too high, we feel deilibtating

Meditation prompting yourself towards flow state.

# Autonmic Nervous System

Autonmic Nervous System (自律神經系統) physiological correlate almost perfectly mirror Yin and Yan / Sun and Moon Concepts.

- Sympathetic nervous system
	- Prep for fight or flight
	- kind of the adrenaline system
	- Elevate heart rate, blood pressure
	- Route blood to survival parts, like brain, arms, legs. Pull blood from stomach, intestines, etc. 
- Parasympathetic nervous system
	- Slow down heart rate, decrease blood pressure
	- Mode of rest and digest
	- Blood pull to internal organs like stomach, intestines, etc.
	- Example: Food Coma

How to balance?
**Nadi Shuddhi** (Alternate nostril breathing)
- Left breath acivate parasympathetic nervous system
- Right breath activate sympathetic nervous system

# Central Nervous System

- Frontal lobes (前額葉), govern:
	- impulse control
	- executive function (capacity to follow-through our plans)
- Limbic system
	- where our emotion come from
- Vertronmedial perfrontal cortex (Vertronmedial perfrontal cortex), part of frontla lobes
	- empathy

After meditation practise, frontal lobes can gain dominance over your limbic system. And develope empathy and compassion toward ourself and others.

# Association cortices

Part of our brain attach meaning to particular events.
In meditation we train about detachment or gaining distance,
