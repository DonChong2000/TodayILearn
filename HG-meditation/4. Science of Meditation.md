Prompt: what is HPA Axis in stress physiology?
Here is what ChatGPT saids:
> The HPA axis is a complex set of interactions between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands that regulates stress response in the body. When we experience stress, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which signals the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol, which is a stress hormone that helps our body respond to stress.
