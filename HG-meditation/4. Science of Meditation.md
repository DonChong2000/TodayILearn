# How long should I meditate?
Science: **20 mins** a day, idealy 5-7 a week, but 20mins every other day is enough.
Less than 20 mins a day, don't seem to have clinically statustucally significant benefit.

Why 20mins? a potential explaination is in stress physiology:

Prompt: what is HPA Axis in stress physiology?
Here is what ChatGPT saids:
> The HPA axis is a complex set of interactions between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands that regulates stress response in the body. When we experience stress, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which signals the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol, which is a stress hormone that helps our body respond to stress.
> HPA轴是下丘脑、垂体和肾上腺之间的一套复杂的相互作用，调节体内的压力反应。当我们经历压力时，下丘脑释放促肾上腺素释放激素（CRH），这信号垂体释放促肾上腺皮质激素（ACTH）。然后ACTH刺激肾上腺释放皮质醇，这是一种应激激素，帮助我们的身体应对压力。

**Meditation for about 17 mins is what required to shut off the HPA axis.**
