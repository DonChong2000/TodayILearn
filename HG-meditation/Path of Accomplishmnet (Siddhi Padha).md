# 1. Karma Fal

Karma: Action
Fal: Fruit

Krishna explains: 
You dont deserve any kind of fruit from your action. 
The only thing that you deserve is the action itself.

Human language:
We are outcome oriented. 
When I dont get the outcome that I want, it shatters our motivation.

Krishna means if you **devote yourselves to your actions** instead of the outcomes, thats the best way forward.

As a human being, you can't control the what happens, you can only control what you do.


# 2. Reframing Goals to Actions

How to change your goal from Goal to Action?
How to living the the present instead of focusing on the future?

The society is outcome oriented, we are taught by the society that outcomes are whats important.
