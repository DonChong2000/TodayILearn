# 1. Karma Fal

Karma: Action
Fal: Fruit

Krishna explains: 
You dont deserve any kind of fruit from your action. 
The only thing that you deserve is the action itself.

Human language:
We are outcome oriented. 
When I dont get the outcome that I want, it shatters our motivation.

Krishna means if you **devote yourselves to your actions** instead of the outcomes, thats the best way forward.

As a human being, you can't control the what happens, you can only control what you do.


# 2. Reframing Goals to Actions

How to change your goal from Goal to Action?
How to living the the present instead of focusing on the future?

The society is outcome oriented, we are taught by the society that outcomes are whats important.

But our brain will work agaist us if we set our goal.
If our brain see an action tied to a good result, we will reinforce that behavior.
If our action doesn't get the desired result, our brain discourage it.

When we set a big goal (e.g Keep fit, go gym):
- We have image of our future self (well built body)
- Everytimes of training, what you see in the mirror: Nothing Change
	- Our brain start to think we are putting all these effort, but we are not really seeing the reward.
	- Brain: This behavior is not attaining the reward, so you actually don't need to continue
