# Brahman (Cosmic consicousness)

Yogis believed most basic stuff in existennce is a sea of formless consicousness, which is Brahman.

Example: 
When Brahman concentrate and coalesces, it become energy. 
When Energy concentrate and coalescse, it become matter.

They believe  all energy and consciousness, and everything we see in the universe, is siturated at Bindu Visarga (a point at the top of your head). Which is an infinitely dense peice of matter, and it explode and create the universe. 

After the universe explode frmo Bindu Visarga, it expand and reaches a terminal point, and collapse back down into Bindu Visarga.

# Karma (Action)

All action have effects, all effect have causes. (Principle of Cause and Effect).
And energy can only be transformed and not destroyed
E.g I throw a ball up in the air, the ball has to come down.

They extend this idea outside of hte physical realm
