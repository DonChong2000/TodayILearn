- Simple self-tests are presented to determine the likelihood of a TFCC injury, highlighting the importance of seeking professional medical advice for thorough examination and diagnosis.
- Detailed exercises and maintenance strategies are provided to improve wrist durability and stability, fostering recovery for confirmed TFCC injuries and prevention for healthy wrists.

# Conclusion
- Consistent wrist exercises not only augment stability but also enhance muscle elasticity, promoting improved wrist mobility and strength, vital for preventing TFCC injuries and facilitating recovery.
- Strengthening the wrist muscles is essential for safeguarding the TFCC and diminishing the risk of sports injuries and overuse.

# Additional Notes
- It is crucial to consult a physician for confirmed TFCC injuries and to perform exercises within a pain-free range, ensuring that exercises are not overly strenuous.
