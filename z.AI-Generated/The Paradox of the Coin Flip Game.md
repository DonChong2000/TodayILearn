Today we played a game that sounds simple but reveals a shockingly counterintuitive mathematical principle. You start with $100 and repeatedly toss a coin. Each time you flip heads, your current amount of money increases by 80%. Each time you flip tails, it decreases by 50%. This leads to an arithmetic mean of 15% average gain per coin toss, which sounds great at first. However, when simulating a million people, each starting with $100 and playing 50 rounds, the average wealth grows exponentially, but the median and mode plummet to a measly $7.2. This is called a non-ergodic system, where the population average is different from the median outcome of individuals. This paradox arises due to the multiplicative nature of the game. However, when a fixed bet size is introduced, the median grows steadily, thanks to the Kelly Criterion, which specifies what fraction of wealth to bet to maximize growth rate. This paradox applies to everything from gambling to social relationships to life decisions. The paradox arises due to the Multiplicative nature of the game. The lower we go, the less we can gain. However, using the Kelly Criterion, it is possible to maximize growth rate and achieve more favorable outcomes.
