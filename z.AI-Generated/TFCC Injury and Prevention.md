# Introduction
- TFCC injury, or Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex injury, can cause wrist pain, stiffness, and immobility.
- The TFCC acts as a shock absorber for the wrists and is prone to injury from lifting, compressive movements, incorrect postures, and overuse.
- The video highlights the importance of understanding TFCC injury for both prevention and recovery.

# Main Content
- TFCC is a form of tough cartilage in the wrist that resembles the intervertebral discs in the spine and the menisci in the knees.
- The TFCC is surrounded by ligaments and joint capsules, and an injury to this area affects all these soft tissues (Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex).
- Movements such as lifting, compressive actions, using a mouse and keyboard, and certain exercises can cause TFCC injuries.
- The video features three simple tests to check for TFCC injury, as well as exercises to increase wrist durability and mobility, with wrist flexion-extension resistance, neutral position support training, rotational resistance training, and radial and ulnar deviation training.

# Conclusion
- Understanding TFCC injury, its causes, and the importance of wrist exercises is crucial for prevention and rehabilitation.
- Preventive measures include maintaining muscle strength and adaptability, which reduces the risk of sports injuries and improves wrist function and mobility.
- The video provides valuable insights into TFCC injury prevention and recovery through exercise.

# Additional Notes
- Regularly performing the recommended exercises strengthens wrist stability, increases muscle elasticity, and improves wrist mobility and strength.
- The video emphasizes consulting a doctor before performing the exercises, especially for those with confirmed TFCC injuries.
