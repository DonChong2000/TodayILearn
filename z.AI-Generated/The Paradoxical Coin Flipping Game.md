# Introduction
The video presents a seemingly simple game involving coin flips and explores a surprising mathematical principle.

# Main Content
- The game starts with $100 and involves flipping a coin with specific gain and loss percentages for heads and tails, respectively.
- It appears to have an average gain of 15% per coin toss, leading to exponential growth at first glance.
- However, a simulation of a million people playing this game for 50 rounds reveals a counterintuitive outcome: while the average wealth grows, the median and mode plummet to a measly $7.2. This phenomenon is attributed to the game being a non-ergodic system.
- The game's multiplicative nature and paradoxical outcome is demonstrated through visualization and mathematical analysis.
- The impact of altering strategies from a multiplicative to an additive approach is explored, leading to the discovery of the Kelly Criterion for maximizing growth rate.

# Conclusion
The Kelly Criterion, introduced in 1956, determines the optimal fraction of wealth to bet in order to maximize growth rate. It has significant implications for decision making in finance and probability.

# Additional Notes
- The video showcases the power of mathematics in revealing paradoxical outcomes and challenging intuitive assumptions.
- The use of visualization and simulation provides a compelling demonstration of complex concepts.
- The Manim graphics library and the Kelly Criterion are key elements in understanding the paradox discussed.
