Here is a summary of the survey conducted by Robert Half ยน:

- 42% of job applicants don't meet the skills requirements for the job they are applying for.
- 84% of companies are willing to hire and train a candidate who lacks required skills.
- 62% of employees have been offered a position when they were underqualified.
- 78% of professionals would apply for a job even if they aren't qualified.

This survey highlights the fact that companies are willing to invest in their employees and provide them with the necessary training to succeed in their roles. It also shows that job seekers should not be discouraged from applying for a job if they don't meet all the qualifications. Instead, they should focus on highlighting their transferable skills and willingness to learn ยน.
