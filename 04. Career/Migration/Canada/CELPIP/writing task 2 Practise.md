# 5G
A:

rephrase main idea:

- Currently our wired internet services still rely on ADSL technology, 5G internet can be as a substitution for optical fiber internet. 'rural area'
- 5G is widely adopted worldwide, it helps our city catch up with the latest technology.
- Some say 5G will lead to more expensive internet services, yet with the introduce of 5G, previous technology usually lower their price.
chara 5G: low latency, instant, wide-bandwidth


In my point of view, it will be beneficial to introduce 5G technology in our city.

First of all, I am living in a rural area, our internet are limited to the slow ADSL technology, 5G provides us a good substitution for upgrading to optical fiber. Currently the internet quality is unbearable, by changing to 5G for our home internet, we can have lower latency and wide-bandwidth internet which will improve our living quality.

Moreover, 5G is widely adopted worldwide, it will help our city to catch up with the latest technology. Our city's infrastructure is not well prepared for the next generation technologies such as IoT, auto pilot, etc. This will build the foundation for further development of our city, therefore promise a brighter future.

Some says bring 5G to the table will lead to over-priced internet services, however I see quite the opposite. Usually with the more competitive 5G option, other company will offer cheaper 4G services to keep their customer, as a result, it will bring better services and cheaper prices for the customers.

All in all, developing 5G in our city is inevitable and it will be advantages for customer and city's future.


B:
Bring 5G to the table will lead to overpriced internet
- infrastructure cost
- monopoly of internet service in this area
- some say it will provide faster communication services, 4G will fulfill most of our needs.
wording:
- monopoly, infrastructure, antenna, overhead, non cost effective, 

# City dev survey

- Downtown should provide all the services a citizen will need, a shopping center offer just that

# traffic management

B:
- It require time for the big change to be made, 
- It create overhead to enforce the new change, and it might create confusion.
- Some say more penalty will solve the issue, but I see quite the opposite, it will lead to rebellion in crown, creating resistance in enforcing the change
