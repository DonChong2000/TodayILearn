Dear HR,

I am writing to seek help from you for the matter of being harassed at work. Today, when I was working on the No.3 assembly line during my morning shift, Harry John, our co-worker, touched my sensitive part intentionally. Harry John and I are just co-workers, with no other relationship in between. He has been harassing me in different form since last month, for instance talking improper joke that has sexual meaning to me on 22th March, during our lunch time. 

Since I am afraid bad things happen, I decided to voice out today, and luckily Mr. Bob witness what Harry did and willing to testify for me. And also you can lookup the CCTV recording today at around 2:30 pm - 3:00 pm, it should have the issue recorded.

I am looking for prompt respond for this matter, thanks you so much for your attention.

Yours sincerely,
Emma
