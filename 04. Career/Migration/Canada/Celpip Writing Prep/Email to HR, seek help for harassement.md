Dear HR,

I am writing to seek help from you for the matter of being harassed at work. Last week, when I was working on the No.3 assembly line, Harry John touched my sensitive part intentionally. Harry John and I are just co-workers, with no other relationship in between. He has been harassing me in different form since last month, for instance talking improper joke that has sexual meaning to me on the last  

I am looking for prompt respond for this matter, thanks you so much for your attenttion.

Yours sincerely,
Emma
