1. Who and relationship with him
2. When where (during the work hours)
4. Evidence


Dear HR,

I am writing to seek help from you for the matter of being harassed at work. Today, when I was working on the No.3 assembly line during my morning shift, Harry John, our co-worker, touched my sensitive part intentionally. Harry John and I are just co-workers, with no other relationship in between. He has been harassing me in different form since last month, for instance talking improper joke that has sexual meaning to me on ==22th== March, during our lunch time. 

Since I am afraid bad things will happen, I decided to voice out today, and luckily Mr. Bob witness what Harry did and willing to testify for me. And also you can lookup the CCTV recording today at around 2:30 pm - 3:00 pm, it should have the issue recorded.

I am looking for prompt ==respond== for this matter, I really appreciate if you can me me on this matter. Thank you very much for your attention.

Yours sincerely,
Emma

Dear HR,

I am writing to seek help for being harassed at work today. Harry John, the technician touched my sensitive part intentionally, I felt offended therefore seeking help from you. Harry John and I has no any relationship other than co-workers, although he teaches me a lot in the project we are working on, we have no romantic relationship at all.

During my morning shift around 1:30pm, I was working on the workstation, and having some trouble about the blueprint. Harry comes from behind and embraced me, touches my chest using both his hand. I was shocked and shout at him. 

Luckily another co-worker at the scene, Mr. Bob witness the whole instance and willing to testify for me. Also I believe the CCTC should have the whole instance recorded.

I would really appreciate if you can response promptly. Thank


Yours sincerely,
Emma
