> [According to the LeetCode community, the runtime and memory measurements are not consistent and are fuzzy numbers due to the nature of the platform, security overhead, and highly dependent on user workload](https://leetcode.com/discuss/feedback/1539664/is-leetcode-runtime-and-memory-measure-consistent)[1](https://leetcode.com/discuss/feedback/1539664/is-leetcode-runtime-and-memory-measure-consistent). The system that LeetCode uses can only measure runtime in elapsed wall-clock time, which will vary from submit to submit due its low resolution of time and due to busier or less busy servers.Â [Their software cannot measure and report the more accurate CPU time](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1747425/leetcode-runtime-compiler-isnt-accurate)[2](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1747425/leetcode-runtime-compiler-isnt-accurate).
