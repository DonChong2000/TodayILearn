- **Speedometer 3.0** is a collaborative effort between major browser engines: **Blink**, **Gecko**, and **WebKit**. It's designed to measure **web application responsiveness** by ==simulating user interactions on real web pages==.
- Unlike previous versions (Speedometer 2 in 2018 and Speedometer 1 in 2014), **Speedometer 3.0** introduces a **better way of measuring performance** and a more representative set of tests that reflect the modern web.
- **New Governance Model**: This benchmark is developed through a ==cross-industry collaboration== supported by each major browser engine. It's hosted in a shared repository open to contribution.
- **==Expanded Test Scenario==s**: Speedometer 3.0 includes new tests that simulate various user interactions, such as rendering canvas and SVG charts, code editing, WYSIWYG editing, and reading news sites. It covers popular frameworks like Angular, React, Vue, and more.
- **Improved Test Runner**: The test runner ==now measures more of the browser's work in response to user actions==, including painting and asynchronous tasks.
